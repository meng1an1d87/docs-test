The team member who created your initial docs will have update access to your docs, as long as they push to your documentation repo with the same Github account that was used while signing up for Mintlify.

If another editor attempts to update the docs while on the free plan, you will see a warning in your git commit check.

[Upgrade your plan](https://dashboard.mintlify.com) to enable unlimited editors to update your docs.
