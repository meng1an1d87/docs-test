To host your docs on a custom subdomain, you'll need to set the custom subdomain you want on your Mintlify settings and configure your DNS settings on your domain provider.

<Info>
  Looking to set up a custom subdirectory domain like mintlify.com/docs? Find
  instructions [here](/subdirectory.mdx).

## Mintlify Settings

Navigate to your [dashboard project](dashboard.mintlify.com) and click "Add custom subdomain". Submit the custom subdomain you want, ommitting `https://www`. For example, `docs.mintlify.com`.

## Vercel Verification

If you're using vercel as your domain provider, you'll need to add a verification `TXT` record. This information will show on your dashboard after submitting your custom subdomain, as well as be emailed to you.

## DNS Configuration

Navigate to the DNS settings for your domain on your domain provider. Add a new DNS entry with the following values.

```
CNAME | docs | cname.vercel-dns.com
```
