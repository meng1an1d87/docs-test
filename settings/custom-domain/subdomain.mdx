To host your docs on a custom subdomain, you'll need to set the custom subdomain you want on your Mintlify settings and configure your DNS settings on your domain provider.

<Info>
  Looking to set up a custom subdirectory domain like mintlify.com/docs? Find
  instructions [here](./subdirectory).

## Mintlify Settings

Navigate to your [dashboard project](https://dashboard.mintlify.com) and click "Add custom subdomain". Submit the custom subdomain you want, ommitting `https://www`. For example, `docs.mintlify.com`.

<Frame>
  <img
    alt="Custom Domain"
    className="block dark:hidden"
    src="/images/add-custom-domain-light.png"
  />
  <img
    alt="Custom Domain"
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/images/add-custom-domain-dark.png"
  />
</Frame>

## Vercel Verification

If you're using vercel as your domain provider, you'll need to add a verification `TXT` record. This information will show on your dashboard after submitting your custom subdomain, as well as be emailed to you.

## DNS Configuration

Navigate to the DNS settings for your domain on your domain provider. Add a new DNS entry with the following values.

```
CNAME | docs | cname.vercel-dns.com
```

<Frame>
  <img alt="DNS" src="https://mintlify-assets.b-cdn.net/mintlify-dns.png" />
</Frame>

If you are using CLoudflare for your DNS provider, you'll need to have the “full strict” security option enabled for the https setting.

Please [contact support](mailto:hi@mintlify.com) if you don't see the custom subdomain set up after the above configuration.
