## Image

### Using Markdown

The [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#images) lets you add images using the following code

```md
![title](/path/image.jpg)
```

Note that the image file size must be less than 5MB. Otherwise, we recommend hosting on a service like [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) or [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). You can then use that URL and embed. 

### Using Embeds

To get more customizability with images, you can also use [embeds](/writing-content/embed) to add images

```html
<img height="200" src="/path/image.jpg" />
```

<Tip>

Although not required, we recommend adding the `alt` and `title` attributes to images for better SEO and accessability. Learn more at [image SEO](https://yoast.com/image-seo-alt-tag-and-title-tag-optimization/).
