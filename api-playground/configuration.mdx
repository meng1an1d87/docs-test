Mintlify supports the following REST API methods:

| Method   | Description                                      |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `GET`    | Retrieve information about the REST API resource |
| `POST`   | Create a REST API resource                       |
| `PUT`    | Update a REST API resource                       |
| `PATCH`  | Update a REST API resource                       |
| `DELETE` | Delete a REST API resource or related component  |

From the defined endpoints, we generate an API playground, request examples, and response examples.

## Step 1: Configure your API

In your `mint.json` file, define your base URL and auth method:

```json
{
  "api": {
    "baseUrl": "https://mintlify.com/api", //String array for multiple base URLs
    "auth": {
      "method": "bearer" // Options: bearer, basic, key.
      // Do not set method if OpenAPI spec includes security field
    }
  }
}
```

If you would not like to show an API playground, you don't need to include auth types. Hide the playground with the following field:

```json
{
  "api": {
    "playground": {
      "mode": "hide"
    }
  }
}
```

Find a full list of API configurations [here](/settings/global#api-configurations).

## Step 2: Create your endpoint pages

Each API endpoint page should have a corresponding MDX file. At the top of each file, define:

```mdx
---
title: "Create new user"
api: "POST https://api.mintlify.com/user"
---
```

If the endpoint has a path parameter, the path should be determined with `{}` rather than `:` - for example:

```bash
https://api.example.com/v1/endpoint/{userId}
```

If you're using an OpenAPI spec, you can autogenerate thes files using our [scraper](/api-playground/openapi-generation). The definition should look like:

```mdx
---
title: "Create new user" // Optional - defaults to OpenAPI endpoint title
openapi: "POST https://api.mintlify.com/user"
---
```

Learn more at the [OpenAPI guide](/api-playground/openapi).

<Note>

If you have `baseUrl` configured in [mint.json](/settings/global), you can use relative paths like `/v1/endpoint`.

## Step 3: Add your endpoints to your docs

Add your endpoint pages to the sidebar by adding the paths to the `navigation` field in your `mint.json`. Learn more about structuring your docs [here](/settings/navigation).

Pro Tip: If you're using OpenAPI, use the scraper output to easily add the paths to your `mint.json` file.
