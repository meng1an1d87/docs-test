### Add an OpenAPI specification file

In order to reference OpenAPI, you must have the OpenAPI file in either a `json` or `yaml` format loaded into the docs folder. The name is irrelevant as long as the file follows [OpenAPI specifications](https://swagger.io/specification/).

### Autogenerate OpenAPI MDX files

To add the OpenAPI endpoints onto your docs, you need to create MDX files for each endpoint. You can autogenerate these MDX files from your OpenAPI spec using our scraper - learn more [here](/api-playground/openapi-generation).

After using the scraper, you can use the terminal output to add the files into your `mint.json` under `navigation` to structure them how you'd like in your docs. Otherwise, manually add the files into your `mint.json`.

### Manually Reference OpenAPI endpoint

<Snippet file="api-playground/openapi.mdx" />

By using the OpenAPI reference, the name, description, parameters, responses, and the API playground will be automatically generated using the specifications.

<Note>
  The method endpoint must match the endpoint specified in the OpenAPI
  specifications exactly. Nothing is displayed if the endpoint doesn't exist in
  the OpenAPI file.
</Note>

### OpenAPI Schema

Generate a page that displays an OpenAPI schema which is defined in an OpenAPI spec's `components.schemas` map.

```md
---
openapi-schema: SchemaKey
---
```
