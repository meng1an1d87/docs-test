Our Mintlify scraper helps autogenerate MDX files for your OpenAPI endpoints. Use the relative path to the Openapi file in your codebase.

```bash
npx @mintlify/scraping@latest openapi-file <path-to-openapi-file>
```

If your OpenAPI file is hosted at a URL, copy the contents into an openapi.json or openapi.yaml file in your codebase to run the scraper once. You can delete this file after scraping has completed.

Add the `-o` flag to specify a folder to populate the files into. If a folder is not specified, the files will populate into the current folder.

```bash
npx @mintlify/scraping@latest openapi-file <path-to-openapi-file> -o api-reference
```
