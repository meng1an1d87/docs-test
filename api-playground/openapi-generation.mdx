Our Mintlify scraper helps autogenerate MDX files for your OpenAPI endpoints. Use the relative path to the Openapi file or a URL to fetch the OpenAPI file.

```bash
npx @mintlify/scraping@latest openapi-file <path-or-url-to-openapi-file>
```

Add the `-o` flag to specify a folder to populate the files into. If a folder is not specified, the files will populate into the current folder.

```bash
npx @mintlify/scraping@latest openapi-file <path-or-url-openapi-file> -o api-reference
```
